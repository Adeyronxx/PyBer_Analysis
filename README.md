# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview:
The purpose of this project is to analyze ride-sharing data categorized by city-types (Rural, Urban and Suburban) on behalf of a ride-share company. We conduct an exploratory analysis on information such as; total rides per city-type, total number of drivers per city-type, and total amount of fares spent on rides in each city-type to explore what each of these mean for the company and the business.

# RESULTS
We will focus on the results as shown by:
1. Total Rides Per City-Type.
2. Total Drivers Per City-Type.
3. Total Amount spent on Fares for Each City-Type.
4. The Average Amount of Fares Per Ride for Each City-Type.
5. The Average Fare Per Driver for Each City-Type.

From the image above, we can determine the following:
1. Urban areas had a total of 1,625 rides making them the city-type with the most rides.
2. There are more drivers in Urban areas when compared to both Rural and Suburban areas.
3. Urban areas had the highest Total Fares.
4. From the average amount spent on rides per city-type we see that individuals in Rural areas spent more on rides than individuals in Urban and Suburban areas.
5. We can also oberve from the average fare per driver, that drivers in Rural areas made more than drivers in Suburban and Urban areas.

# WEEKLY TOTAL FARE PER CITY-TYPE [DATES: JANUARY 2019 TO APRIL 2019]

In the figure above, we proceeded to analyze the data for each city-type and plot this using a multiple line plot. From the figure above we can observe a simultaneous peak in ride fares in all city-types on February the 24th. In urban areas we observe a slight fall  in early March and a decline towards the end of April.
For Suburban areas, the initial peak is followed by a deep fall into March and we see a consistent rise in fare prices around early april.
Lastly, In Rural areas after the initial peak we see a slight fall in fares in early march another peak in late march and we see the fare prices begin to fall slightly going into the end of april.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Rural Areas: Hire more drivers and Advertise services to lessen fares and simultaneously increase demand.
2. Urban Areas: Offer incentives to attract more riders.
3. Suburban Areas: Offer incentives and advertise services to increase demand for rides.
